## 📦 Clone and Build the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open **Terminal** (Applications → Utilities → Terminal) and run:

```bash
# Navigate to a folder where you want to download the project
cd ~/Desktop  # or any folder you prefer

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/omni-BASE.git

# Navigate to the project
cd omni-BASE/apps/omnitak

# Verify you're in the right place
ls -la
```

**Expected output should include:**
```
OmniTAKMobile.xcodeproj      <- This is the Xcode project file
OmniTAKMobile/               <- This folder contains all the code
README.md                    <- This file
...
```

✅ **If you see `OmniTAKMobile.xcodeproj`, you're in the right place!**
❌ **If not found:** You may be in the wrong directory. Run `pwd` to see where you are.

### Step 2: Open in Xcode and Build for Simulator

**This is the easiest way to test - no iPhone needed!**

```bash
# Open the project in Xcode (from Terminal)
open OmniTAKMobile.xcodeproj
```

**Xcode should open with the project loaded.**

#### Configure Simulator (One-Time Setup)

1. **At the top-left of Xcode**, you'll see a device dropdown next to "OmniTAKMobile"
2. Click the device dropdown
3. You'll see a list like:
   ```
   iPhone 16 Pro
   iPhone 16
   iPhone 15 Pro
   iPad Pro
   ...
   ```
4. **Select any iPhone simulator** (e.g., "iPhone 16 Pro")

✅ **The dropdown should now show:** `OmniTAKMobile > iPhone 16 Pro`

#### Build and Run

**Method 1: Using Xcode GUI (Recommended)**

1. Click the **▶ Play button** at top-left (or press `⌘ + R`)
2. Watch the build progress bar at the top
3. **First build takes 2-5 minutes** - be patient!
4. You'll see messages like:
   ```
   Building...
   Compiling MapViewController.swift
   Linking...
   Build Succeeded
   ```
5. The iOS Simulator will launch automatically
6. The OmniTAKMobile app will open showing a map

**Method 2: Using Terminal (Advanced)**

```bash
# Build the app
xcodebuild -scheme OmniTAKMobile \
  -configuration Debug \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' \
  build

# Look for this at the end:
# ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

#### What You Should See

After the app launches in the simulator:
- 📱 An iOS device window appears (looks like a real iPhone)
- 🗺️ A satellite map view (centered on Washington DC by default)
- 📊 Status bar at top showing "OmniTAK" and connection status
- 🎯 Bottom toolbar with GPS, zoom, draw buttons
- 🔴 "DISC" (disconnected) indicator - this is normal (no server configured yet)

**Simulator Limitations:**
- ❌ GPS location is simulated (doesn't use real location)
- ❌ Can't connect to real TAK servers without network configuration
- ✅ All UI features work perfectly
- ✅ Drawing, maps, and offline features work

---

### Step 3: Build for Physical iPhone/iPad (Optional)

**Want to test on your actual iPhone? Follow these steps.**

#### A. Configure Code Signing (One-Time - ~3 minutes)

**Why do I need this?** Apple requires all apps to be signed, even for testing on your own device.

1. **In Xcode, look at the left sidebar**
   - You should see a blue **OmniTAKMobile** icon at the top
   - Click on it

2. **Select the Target**
   - In the main editor area, you'll see "TARGETS" list
   - Click **"OmniTAKMobile"** under TARGETS

   - Select your **Apple ID** (it should say "Personal Team")

5. **Change Bundle Identifier (if error appears)**
   - If you see a red error like "Failed to register bundle identifier"
   - Change the **Bundle Identifier** from `com.omnitak.mobile` to something unique like:
     ```
     com.yourname.omnitak.mobile
     ```
   - Replace `yourname` with your actual name or any unique text

✅ **Success looks like:**
- No red errors in the Signing section
- You see "Signing Certificate: Apple Development: your@email.com"
- Bundle Identifier is unique

❌ **Common errors:**
- "Failed to create provisioning profile" → Your Apple ID isn't added to Xcode (see Prerequisites Step 4)
- "Bundle identifier already in use" → Change the bundle ID to something unique

#### B. Connect Your iPhone/iPad

1. **Connect your device to your Mac**
   - Use a USB-C or Lightning cable
   - **Must be a data cable** (not just charging cable)

2. **Unlock your iPhone/iPad**

3. **Trust This Computer popup**
   - On your iPhone/iPad, you'll see: "Trust This Computer?"
   - Tap **"Trust"**
   - Enter your device passcode

4. **Enable Developer Mode** (iOS 16+ only)
   - On your iPhone/iPad: **Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Developer Mode**
